## Getting Started
 
After making your purchase, you will have access to the script through [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants). From there, you can download it. Once you've downloaded the script, follow the steps below.
 
<Steps>
### Extract the ZIP File
 
You have the file `fiveasy-notify.pack.zip`. Right-click on it and then select `Extract All`.
 
### Place the Extracted Script in Your Resources (Your Server)
 
After placing the script in your `resources` folder, go to the `server.cfg` file and add the command `ensure fiveasy-notify` for automatic initialization of the script along with your server.

### Grant Permission to Access the Script's Interface

All players have access to the command `notify-get-permission`, which will provide the necessary permission for the player. To grant this permission, follow the next step.

Example: `add_ace identifier.license:<Player's License> notify.editor allow`

After copying this permission, paste it into the `server.cfg` and restart the server. You will then have access to the script's interface.
