## Notify Get Permission

All players have access to the `notify-get-permission` command, which provides the player's permission details. This permission can then be granted by following the next step.

Example response: `add_ace identifier.license:<Player's License> notify.editor allow`

After copying this permission, paste it into the `server.cfg` file and restart the server. You will then have access to the script's interface.
